## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Collection Management

**Q: How do card variants work?**  
A: Some cards have multiple variants (Holo, Reverse Holo, Normal, 1st Edition, etc.). When adding a card with variants to your collection:
- First time: Select which variant you're adding
- Already own a variant: Click the "+ Variant" button to add additional variants of the same card
- Each variant is tracked separately, so you can collect all variants of a single card

**Q: What's the difference between Collection and Wishlist?**  
A: 
- **Collection**: Cards you physically own
- **Wishlist**: Cards you want to buy/trade for
- You can add missing cards from your Favorites binder to the Wishlist in bulk using the "+ Wishlist" button

### Data Backup & Export

**Q: How do I backup my collection data?**  
A: Use the Export/Import feature in the Favorites tab:
1. Go to Favorites → Pokemon tab
2. Click "📥 Export" to save your data
3. Choose to copy to clipboard or save to Downloads folder
4. The export includes all your favorite Pokemon and owned cards (with variants)

**Q: How do I restore my collection on a new device?**  
A: 
1. Go to Favorites → Pokemon tab
2. Click "📤 Import"
3. Paste your previously exported JSON data or select the file
4. Click "Import" - your favorites and collection will be restored
5. The import automatically avoids duplicates

**Q: What data is included in the export?**  
A: The export includes:
- All favorite Pokemon
- All owned cards with their variants
- Card conditions and grading information
- Purchase prices and dates
- Everything needed to fully restore your collection

**Q: Can I export my Wishlist?**  
A: Yes! In the Wishlist screen, tap the share/export icon to save your wishlist. You can share it as text or save it locally.

### Pricing Data

**Q: Where do card prices come from?**  
A: Card prices are sourced from two APIs:
- **TCGdex**: Primary source for card data and pricing
- **PokeWallet.io**: Backup source that fills in missing prices
- Prices are automatically fetched when you load cards

**Q: Why don't all cards have prices?**  
A: Some cards (especially older or Japanese exclusive cards) may not have pricing data available in the APIs. We're continuously working to improve price coverage.

### Language & Cards

**Q: Can I search for Japanese cards?**  
A: Yes! In the Favorites screen:
1. Select a Pokemon
2. Switch to the "Cards" tab
3. Toggle between "English" and "Japanese" using the language selector
4. Japanese cards will show the set names in Japanese characters

**Q: How many cards are in the database?**  
A: The app has access to 1000+ Pokemon cards across multiple sets and languages, with new cards added regularly through API updates.
